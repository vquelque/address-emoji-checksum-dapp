# 🔑 Emoji Crypto Address Checksum

This project provides a simple tool to **checksum any EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) or Bitcoin address** using a string of **4 easily recognizable emoji characters**.
We draw inspiration from Telegram security emojis.

🎨 We've curated the list of emojis to ensure they are distinct and user-friendly.

## 🛡️ Why Use This?

Transferring crypto funds can be stressful.
There’s always a lingering worry:
- Did you copy-paste the address correctly?
- Has the address been tampered with by a malicious party?

With this project, you can:
- Generate a checksum for your address.
- Share the checksum along with your address for verification by others.

By providing an easy-to-use address checksum, we aim to **reduce the anxiety of crypto transactions**.
